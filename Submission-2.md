# Exposure of Backup File to an Unauthorized Control Sphere

### Severity: High

## Issue Description

This identifies **a backup file is stored in a directory or archive that is made accessible to unauthorized actors.** Potentially containing sensitive data and being accessible from the web.

During a security assessment or penetration test, a file named **"dump.sql"** was discovered. 

This file is considered potentially significant due to its potential to contain sensitive or valuable information, such as database backups or certification files.

## Risk Rating

- Severity: **High**

- Difficulty to Exploit: **High**



## Affected URLs/Area

- http://15.206.81.14:31337/


## Enumeration

This file is described as a **"potentially interesting backup/cert file"** in the report.

Backup files, such as **"dump.sql,"** often contain **sensitive information, including database backups, configurations, or credentials.** If left unprotected or accessible to unauthorized parties, these files could be exploited by attackers to gain valuable insights into the system's architecture, access sensitive data, or escalate privileges.

Furthermore, the **"dump.sql"** file may contain information that could aid attackers in their reconnaissance efforts or facilitate further exploitation of vulnerabilities within the system.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) reference provided in the report **(CWE-530)** refers to the "Exposure of Backup File to **Unauthorized Control Sphere" vulnerability**, which highlights the risk associated with exposing backup files to unauthorized access.
    

  

## Findings


 - The SQL dump was found (directory)
 <a href="https://ibb.co/KFNPf2C"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/D5GJv93/ss4.png" alt="ss4" border="0"></a>
 
 - The contents of the SQL dump and any sensitive information it may contain.

From the above SQL dump, several critical findings can be identified

 - **WordPress Default Post Content:****

    -   The SQL dump includes an update to the `wp_posts` table, setting the post content for the default WordPress post titled **"Hack Me If You Can."** 
 
 The provided SQL statement is an INSERT command aimed at adding a new entry to the **wp_users** table within the WordPress database.
 
 Additionally These are the user where **several critical findings** can be identified.

-   *ID :-* **'2'** is the ID assigned to the user.
-   *user_login :-* **'editor'** is the username for the user.
-   *user_pass  :-* **MD5('editor').**
-   *user_nicename:* **'Editor'** is the display name or nickname for the user.
-   *user_email* :- **'editor@yourdomain.com'** is the email address associated with the user.
-   *user_registered* :-**'2020-01-01 00:00:00'** represents the registration date and time for the user.



 - **Creation of Default Editor User:**

	 - The SQL dump contains INSERT statements to create a new user named   **"editor"** with **administrative privileges.** The password for this user is stored using the **MD5 hashing algorithm**, which is considered **weak and insecure**.
	 

 - **Granting Administrative Privileges to Editor User:**

	 - Additional INSERT statements modify the **wp_usermeta** table to *grant administrative capabilities* **wp_capabilities** and set the user level **wp_user_level** for the newly created **"editor"** user. 
This effectively elevates the privileges of the **"editor"** user to that of **an administrator.**

  
 - **Insecure Password Storage:**

    -   Storing passwords using the **MD5 hashing algorithm** is considered insecure, as it is susceptible to **brute-force and rainbow table attacks.** This poses a significant security risk, especially for ***users with administrative privileges***.
    
## Recommended Fix

  It's essential to promptly secure the **"dump.sql"** file by **restricting access permissions, encrypting its contents if necessary,** and ensuring that it is not publicly accessible.
 
 - **Limit exposure:** By removing the file from the web root, you significantly reduce the attack surface and make it harder for attackers to find and access it.
  
  
 - **Implement data retention policies** to determine the appropriate lifespan of backup files like **"dump.sql"** and ensure that they are securely deleted or archived once they are no longer needed. This helps reduce t**he risk of unauthorized access to outdated or unnecessary data.**
